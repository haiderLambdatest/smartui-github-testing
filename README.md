* [Getting Started With Github App Integration with SmartUI](#getting-started-with-github-app-integration-with-smartui)

## Pre-requisites

* An account with Github with valid permission to install new applications to your repositories.
* Basic understanding of Continuos Integration tools (CI) is required.
* Should have setup the SmartUI suite, else please read [this](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/selenium-visual-regression/).

## Getting Started With Github App Integration with SmartUI

### Steps 1: Integrate the your Lambdatest Account with GitHub App.

You can integrate your LambdaTest account with the GiHub application in the following ways:

- Using OAuth

![github-app-landing-92ef6e152a7302cb9ab88f5034b9ec0c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126776938/232715867-f375b4df-1bc9-4e88-8340-44e986be2e9a.png)

### Step 2: Select your GitHub repository

Go to your GitHub repository where you want to configure your SmartUI project. Check out our GitHub sample [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/smartui-node-sample).

### Step 3: Configure your test suite

Add the `Github` capability to your current test configuration:

```bash {"id":"01HWAFWEYGEXVSMJCB2CKFCSDN"}
const capabilities: {
  platform: "Windows 10",
  browserName: "chrome",
  version: "latest",
  "smartUI.project": "Smart UI sample test",
   github: {
    "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/statuses/commitId", // Mandatory
    "owner": "{OWNER}",  //Optional
    "repo": "{REPO}",  //Optional
    "commit": "{commitId}" //Optional
   }
}
```

### Step 4: Setting up your CI configuration

Setting up your CI workflow to execute on GitHub. Here is an example setup with `GitHub Actions`:

Go to `.github/workflows/<your_ci_file>.yml`.

```bash {"id":"01HWAFWEYHTNW1BFEH1B42Q0EE"}
    name: Execute SmartUI Test with Github App Integration
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1



    - name: Create commit status
      run: |
        API_HOST=https://api.github.com
        # Check out the PR branch
        git checkout $GITHUB_HEAD_REF
        # Get the commit ID of the last commit
        COMMIT_ID=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
        echo "Last commit ID of PR: $COMMIT_ID"
        GITHUB_URL=$API_HOST/repos/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/statuses/$COMMIT_ID
        echo "GITHUB_URL: $GITHUB_URL"
        echo "GITHUB_URL=$GITHUB_URL" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        
```

### Step5: Execute your test suite with CI

After the setup is completed, you can now execute your test suite with the Continuos Integration (CI) pipeline with any tool of your choice.

**Please Note:** *On running the tests with this repository the user should be able to trigger the `GitHub Action` and execute the `SmartUI` tests for `Selenium`, `Cypress, CDP, and Taiko` frameworks. As this action does not work for `StoryBook`, check our how you can SmartUI test with `StoryBook` [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/smartui-storybook).*

### Step 6: Commit you changes over git on a branch and raise the PR to main branch.

### Step 7: Now you will see the `lambdatest-smartui-app` in the PR.
